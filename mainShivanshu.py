    ## How It Works
    1. **Image Upload**: Use the file uploader to upload a retinal image.
    2. **Prediction**: Click the 'Predict' button to start the analysis.
    3. **Results**: Receive instant feedback on the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy.

    ## Why Early Detection Matters
    Early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy can significantly reduce the risk of severe vision impairment. Regular screenings and prompt interventions can help manage the disease effectively and protect your vision.
